This tiny project (namely "lw's toy") containing some CPP file to complement a function,
which can read 5*10^6 random integer data varies from 1 to 10^7 and sort them using just 1.25 MB storage.

the awsome algorithm trick learned from 'Programming Pearls' writen by Jon Bentley.
the basic idea of algorithm is likely Counting sort (aka. bit sort).

I use 'random' to create a text file containing 5000000 random integer number.
After that 'toy' can sort and output ascendingly.
